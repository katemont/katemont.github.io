description: Cloudify was my very first Rails app, built after just 5 weeks of learning. The app allows users to share and listen to music and artwork and personalise their profile pages. It also allows commenting and comment moderation and uses a range of gems including Carrierwave, RMagick, CanCanCan and Acts as Commentable.
